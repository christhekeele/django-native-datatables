# Django Native Datatables #

Status: Dead. Sorry guys, nothing to see here.

This project never hit 1.0. It was a cool idea, but it never lived past the project it was tied to I was developing. 

When that project got cancelled, development on this stopped and I never got it to a point where it could walk on its own two legs.

If anyone wants to grab this and run with it, please let me know, but I'm afraid even the source is too stale to easily get momentum going on this again.

Such are the tribulations of open source!
